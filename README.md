# DistributedErlang
This project is a collection of simple functions that are used to demonstrate Erlang's native distribution capabilities.

The tutorial will take you through all the basics needed to setup a fully functioning Erlang cluster of nodes.

After completing this exercise, you'll have the capability of setting up custom distribution algorithms for a simple factorial service in your Erlang cluster.
